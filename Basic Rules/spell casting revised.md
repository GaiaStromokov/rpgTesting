### The Asymmetric Magic System

In this world, the principle of equivalent exchange makes magic a taxing endeavor. To circumvent the high costs, different classes of spellcasters have developed unique ways to harness and cast magic, each with its own mechanics and gameplay experience.

#### **Scribe**
- **Spell Optimization:** Scribes cast multiple small spells instead of one large one, optimizing the overall effect. This involves strategic planning and resource management.
- **Careful Wording:** Players choose precise phrasing for spells to reduce energy costs. This can lead to creative problem-solving as they find the best way to word their spells for maximum efficiency.
- **Versatile Toolset:** Scribes have access to a wide range of minor spells that can be combined in various ways, offering flexibility and adaptability in different situations.


#### **Innate**
- **Inheritance Rituals:** Innates perform rituals or make small offerings to their ancestral spirits to gain boons. This involves choosing the right offering to invoke specific powers.
- **Bloodline-Specific Magic:** The spells and abilities available to Innates are limited to those of their bloodline, making them highly specialized. This includes passive traits and active spells.
- **Limited Versatility:** While their powers are potent, they are constrained by the nature of their lineage, requiring players to think creatively within those limits.


#### **Priest**
- **Faith-Based Casting:** Priests cast spells through prayer and devotion, relying on divine intervention. This means spells are more powerful and cost-effective when the priest's faith is strong.
- **Divine Insights:** Players receive spell-like abilities through visions and prayers, often requiring role-playing elements like chanting or performing rituals.
- **Piety Mechanics:** The strength and variety of spells depend on the priest's level of devotion and adherence to their deity's principles, adding a layer of moral and ethical decision-making.


#### **WildKin**

- **Rituals and Offerings:** Druids perform regular rituals and make offerings to natural spirits to gain temporary boons. This involves timing and planning rituals to maintain their powers.
- **Innate Boons:** These boons enhance the Druid's abilities, such as shape-shifting, elemental control, or enhanced physical traits. The powers are temporary and require ongoing maintenance.
- **Temporal Magic:** The duration of the boons varies, requiring Druids to continuously interact with nature and perform rituals, creating a dynamic and immersive gameplay experience.

#### **SpellWrite**
Spellwrites, or reskinned bards interpret magic as a song itself, instead of shaping raw aether with the mind of a mage, they are insteead trained to sense the currents of magic, the weave going throughout the world, and with specific notes only they can hear or play, amplify certain parts of the weave, a cacophany of such notes leading to the wanted effect, a chorus of either blessings or deafening lions roars

**1. Song Initiation**
	Songs act like spells for the bard. While they may know many songs for the people, those made specifically for magic are more rare leading to the majority of bards having only around 10 (they are basically spells)
	Each day they choose a number of songs to fully commit to memory and may use each once before needing to rest t

**2. Reactive Notes: Played on Ally or Enemy Actions** These notes are triggered in response to specific actions taken by allies or enemies during combat, each type offering unique effects.

- **Sweet Notes:**
    - **Effect:** Triggered when an ally succeeds in an attack, granting +1 bonus damage.
- **Sour Notes:**
    - **Effect:** Triggered when an ally is successfully hit, granting a bonus on their next attack.
- **Harmonic Notes:**
    - **Effect:** Triggered when an ally casts a spell, reducing the spell's resource cost by 1.
- **Rhythmic Notes:**
    - **Effect:** Triggered when an ally successfully dodges an attack, gaining 1 hit point.
- **Melodic Notes:**
    - **Effect:** Triggered when an enemy is targeted by a spell, granting +1 bonus to the enemy's next dodge attempt.
**3. Crescendo Effects** After playing a sequence of notes, the accumulated effects crescendo into more potent magical manifestations.
- **Minor Crescendo:** Activated when at least 3 different notes are played in a single turn rotation, enhancing the base song's effects, such as increasing duration or potency of ongoing effects.
- **Major Crescendo:** Activated when at least 5 different notes are played in a single turn rotation, unleashing a significant augmentation of the base song's effects, potentially affecting multiple targets or areas with enhanced magical prowess.
