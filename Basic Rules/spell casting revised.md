### The Asymmetric Magic System

In this world, the principle of equivalent exchange makes magic a taxing endeavor. To circumvent the high costs, different classes of spellcasters have developed unique ways to harness and cast magic, each with its own mechanics and gameplay experience.

#### **Scribe**

**Masters of Magical Language and Optimization**

**Mechanics:**

- **Spell Optimization:** Scribes cast multiple small spells instead of one large one, optimizing the overall effect. This involves strategic planning and resource management.
- **Careful Wording:** Players choose precise phrasing for spells to reduce energy costs. This can lead to creative problem-solving as they find the best way to word their spells for maximum efficiency.
- **Versatile Toolset:** Scribes have access to a wide range of minor spells that can be combined in various ways, offering flexibility and adaptability in different situations.

**Gameplay Feel:** Playing a Scribe feels like being a meticulous planner and strategist. You spend time crafting the perfect combination of spells and carefully wording them to conserve energy, making every casting feel like solving a puzzle.

#### **Innate**

**Bearers of Magical Bloodlines**

**Mechanics:**

- **Inheritance Rituals:** Innates perform rituals or make small offerings to their ancestral spirits to gain boons. This involves choosing the right offering to invoke specific powers.
- **Bloodline-Specific Magic:** The spells and abilities available to Innates are limited to those of their bloodline, making them highly specialized. This includes passive traits and active spells.
- **Limited Versatility:** While their powers are potent, they are constrained by the nature of their lineage, requiring players to think creatively within those limits.

**Gameplay Feel:** Playing an Innate feels like channeling ancient power and honoring a legacy. You carefully manage your rituals and offerings to maximize the benefits of your bloodline, making strategic choices based on your heritage's strengths.

#### **Priest**

**Conduits of Divine Power**

**Mechanics:**

- **Faith-Based Casting:** Priests cast spells through prayer and devotion, relying on divine intervention. This means spells are more powerful and cost-effective when the priest's faith is strong.
- **Divine Insights:** Players receive spell-like abilities through visions and prayers, often requiring role-playing elements like chanting or performing rituals.
- **Piety Mechanics:** The strength and variety of spells depend on the priest's level of devotion and adherence to their deity's principles, adding a layer of moral and ethical decision-making.

**Gameplay Feel:** Playing a Priest feels like being a devoted servant of the divine, constantly balancing faith and action. Your spells are powerful and deeply tied to your role-playing choices, emphasizing the importance of maintaining your piety.

#### **WildKin**

**Keepers of the Old Faith**

**Mechanics:**

- **Rituals and Offerings:** Druids perform regular rituals and make offerings to natural spirits to gain temporary boons. This involves timing and planning rituals to maintain their powers.
- **Innate Boons:** These boons enhance the Druid's abilities, such as shape-shifting, elemental control, or enhanced physical traits. The powers are temporary and require ongoing maintenance.
- **Temporal Magic:** The duration of the boons varies, requiring Druids to continuously interact with nature and perform rituals, creating a dynamic and immersive gameplay experience.

**Gameplay Feel:** Playing a Druid feels like being a guardian of nature, constantly interacting with the environment and performing rituals. Your powers are temporary but potent, encouraging you to stay connected to the natural world and its cycles.



#### **SpellWrite**
Spellwrites, or reskinned bards interpret magic as a song itself, instead of shaping raw aether with the mind of a mage, they are insteead trained to sense the currents of magic, the weave going throughout the world, and with specific notes only they can hear or play, amplify certain parts of the weave, a cacophany of such notes leading to the wanted effect, a chorus of either blessings or deafening lions roars
