Spell casting in this world is innately difficult, because of set in stone rules, it takes equivalent exchange of kinetic energy to manifest magic into the world, which statistically becomes so taxing on the human body that without great reserves of magic it is not feasible to shape raw magic. Thus classes came into being
Each with a way to circumvent casting costs

###### Scribe
One who researches the language of magic with the aim of deriving enough knowledge of it so that they can circumvent casting costs.

Their spells primarily aim at being as optimized as possible, sacrificing innate power for lots of small spells that add up to the same effect, or using carefull wording to ensure that large spells have certain limitations to reduce use. Similar to using less infill on a print to get the same shape.

###### Innate
Innates are as the title implies, people blessed by a connection to some form of highly advanced magical race, giving them access too a system known as inheritance. Where they instead of drawing on their own innate power, give small offerings to a greater bloodline in order to call in boons to have the same effect. However because it is tied to a bloodline and not the study of the character themselves, they are limited to the kinds of magic that their bloodline has given them

###### Priests
Priests are similar to scribes, however their magic is instead gained by the reading and worship of their scripture. The manifestation and power of their prayer giving them access too insights, spell like abilities that allows them to call on the innate power of their belief and have it be summoned by their deity instead of manifesting anything themselves


###### Druids
Of the old faith, druids have become so invested and enraptured by the old ways that many still use the original magic of sacrifice. Druids give blood sacrifices to their choice of spirit every x days., or day. The level of sacrifice and to whom allowing them a number of innate boons for that time period, allowing them to be more of a powered being rather then one innately casting spells. For example, giving blood to a thorn god may give one the ability to grow them from ones body, or shape change into a wolf or a snake depending on the spirit.
