All rolls are rolled via 2d6
bonuses will either add additional dice, upgrade a dice, or give a flat bonus to the rolls

on double ones #checkthis 
if you roll a 6, the dice will explode, automatically giving you another roll of the dice
this can stack, disadvantage/curses/injury will take away dice
if you would ever roll less then 1 dice, you instead roll 1 dice and it cannot explode


advantage and disadvantage is given in 3 tiers
general= +- 1 dice
large= += 2 dice
massive= +- 4

upgrading/degrading dice
certain things can determine what dice you are rolling

weapons: while the majority use d6's some will instead have you roll one or both dice as a greater/lesser dice
a dagger for example uses 2d4, while a great maul may use 2d10
