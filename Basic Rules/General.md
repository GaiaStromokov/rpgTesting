Inherant stats are given the following scores at level 1


all character backstories will either add or subtract to this, no score can go below -5

### **LIFE FORCE**
life force is dependent on character race
"strong" races having about 7
"average" races having 5
"weak" races having 3
life force can only be refueled by a long rest, which is under direction of a medically trained person, taking about 15 days, half of which is in recovery when light tasks and movement can be done

## **WROUGHT**
Wrought is a manifestation of mental will, and is calculated by your WIll+int+your primary classes bonus, generally around the same as wear, if not higher

this is a health pool used to fight back against common mental attacks, as well as withstand the sapping power of magical items, and magical effects, each taking part of your wear
## **WEAR**
wear is a manifestion of both luck, defense, armor, and skill taking the place of standard hit points
Wear is a combination of might+Dex+whatever your primary class gives you
generally at first level it will be around 4 or 5
if you run out of wear, you will reach a point of death, when in this state any additional damage will be subtracted from your life points, if that is reduced to zero then you truly die 

## **ARMOR**
Armor is a score starting at 1
every time one takes damage it is reduced by the armor score, if in one attack, double the armor score damage is taken, reduce the armor score by 1, if at one, it must be 4 times as much damage as the armor score (so 4), this is to let armor remain relevant even when broken


## **DICE**
Dice are rolled via 2d6 with snake eyes rules,  rolling 2 of any kind of dice will result in you tallying their score, and rolling again adding the rolled dice to the running score, this can happen any given ammount of times


## Rolling

Rolling will happen at a couple of junctions
the outcome has chance involved
the outcome requires effort
the outcome is being contested

they will at these junctions, roll the dice, add their given modifiers and try to beat the ac
meeting the ac exactly will result in a critical, either doubling damage, or making the check succeed automatically
