All spell casters draw from one list, each spell being a manifestation of reality brought to bear by the spell caster. And while each spell is as written the same, each kind of spell caster manifests/interprets spells in a different way

Wizards: have more control/gain more options from spells, spells will gain specific aiming properties, the ability to target more people, or gain more information from scrying/detect magic like abilities

Sorcerers/innates lack the ability to know as much about their spells, instead using a tag based system to cast what they have seen spells to be, or how they think spells should happen. Thus lacking more options like the wizard, but gaining more combat capabilities from the raw strength of magic

Clerics similar to wizards gain a research/taught form of magic that others lack, though similar to dark souls, their magic is interpreted as gifts from their diety, making spells of the dieties circle/domain be empowered, those of opposing domains weaker, and all arround changing the damage type of many things to radiant instead of a different type

Bards being masters of sound and magic, may learn a great many spells, however those requiring somatic components are greatly empowered and gain more options that others, not being able to sense the sound in the spells do



Spell casting is broken into tags, there will be a list of predefined tags at the end of the document


Magic takes the form of 2 different kinds of magic
direct evocation and manifestation

Evocation is the act of directly pulling magic from the world, shaping it to your whim to then act back on the world, examples would include bouts of fire, summoned creatures, balls of lightning, spiritual weapons and the like. While still possible in this world and system, the knowledge is very limited as in the current era, evoking magic takes the kinetic energy used in the evocation directly from the reserves of the mage, making it very costly.

Manifestation is the primary form of magic, instead of shaping the world directly. You instead instill powerfull beleifs in the minds of allies and enemies that certain effects have come upon them, leading their bodies to react as they would if it were really happening. And because it is solely a contest of mind this is the primary way people spell cast. It is akin to a mass magic psycosis
It might be difficult to truly cast a fire ball on the enemy as you would need a energy supply the size of an elephant, but coating your enemies mind in the lie that his lungs burn from the inside still causes such pain against them
