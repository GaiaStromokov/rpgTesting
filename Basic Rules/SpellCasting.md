All spell casters draw from one list, each spell being a manifestation of reality brought to bear by the spell caster. And while each spell is as written the same, each kind of spell caster manifests/interprets spells in a different way

Wizards: have more control/gain more options from spells, spells will gain specific aiming properties, the ability to target more people, or gain more information from scrying/detect magic like abilities

Sorcerers/innates lack the ability to know as much about their spells, instead using a tag based system to cast what they have seen spells to be, or how they think spells should happen. Thus lacking more options like the wizard, but gaining more combat capabilities from the raw strength of magic

Clerics similar to wizards gain a research/taught form of magic that others lack, though similar to dark souls, their magic is interpreted as gifts from their diety, making spells of the dieties circle/domain be empowered, those of opposing domains weaker, and all arround changing the damage type of many things to radiant instead of a different type

Bards being masters of sound and magic, may learn a great many spells, however those requiring somatic components are greatly empowered and gain more options that others, not being able to sense the sound in the spells do
